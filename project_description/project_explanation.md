# What is the male gaze vs female gaze?

The male gaze is a term in the film industry used to describe how the viewer should see the things presented to him through the lens of the heterosexual male.


Think of any movies that were directed by men, and you’ll find that most often than not, they’re filmed in a way that pleasures the male viewer, enticing them to watch the movie. But the male gaze is prominent everywhere in media, not only in movies. In ads, magazine covers, books, everywhere we turn, we have a life shaped by the male gaze.


The female gaze, on the other hand, was the term created by feminist film theorist Laura Mulvey, who used it to counter the male gaze in movies. 


This project aims to collect and quantify data around these two lenses, specifically using 13 male celebrities to analyze the differences in gazes.  “Why just male celebrities?” you may ask. Great question! The answer comes in two parts. First, when it comes to beauty standards, the difference between the male gaze and the female gaze becomes incredibly prominent. The majority of women don’t find alpha gym bros attractive. Not anymore. Just remember how women went crazy over Harry Styles wearing the skirt on his Vogue cover. Men were appalled while women online were practically screaming that this is what they want. And second, objectifying and rating women is, by definition, screwed towards the male gaze. And is just historically more oppressive than rating men.
